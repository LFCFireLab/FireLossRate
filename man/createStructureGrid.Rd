}
\arguments{
\item{structures}{File containing structures' polygons}

\item{cellSize}{Length of edge of grid squares, in meters}

\item{mode}{Mode to adopt when counting structures in multiple squares: "maximal" to count each occurrence, "minimal" to count it just in square covering most of its surface}

\item{internalBuffer}{Distance from border of grid containing structures to be excluded, in meters. Default value is FALSE}

\item{xmin, ymin}{Specify a corner of portion of structures' file to consider}

\item{xmax, ymax}{Specify opposite corner of portion of structures' file to consider}

\item{templateGrid}{A raster file with the grid to use for counting the structures: if not NULL, cellSize is ignored}
}
\value{
Grid of squares with edge cellSize, with count of associated structures

Grid of squares with edge cellSize or with the same characteristics as the templateGrid, with count of associated structures
}
